# Quick LFG - A universal looking for group application.

This is the source code for our universal looking for group web application. It's built with React, TypeScript, SCSS, Firebase, and React Bootstrap component library.

This was made as our final project for AW Academy Online Coding Bootcamp.

## Instructions

If you wanna run it yourself, follow these steps.

1. Create a Firebase web-app
2. Clone the repo
3. Create src/firebaseConfig.ts and export your Firebase-secret as firebaseConfig
4. Run `npm install`
5. Run `npm start`
6. Enjoy!

## More stuff

Since this is based on Create React App, you have the usual available scripts to you, like:

- `npm start`
- `npm test`
- `npm build`
- `npm eject` (Don't do this unless you know what you're doing!)

Please refer to the [Create React App documentation](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/getting-started) for more information!
